# brainpipe

## Description
Brainpipe is a toolbox to analyse neuro-physiological signals. For instance, it's specialised for eeg, seeg and ecog signals. The aim of this toolbox is to extract informations from data [= features], to classify them and to find the best features combination from wide variety of features. Here is the list of the current implemented modules and there respectiv description:
- bpstudy : managed features / file database
- Extract physiological informations using mni/talairach coordonates of electrodes
- feature : extract power, phase, phase-amplitude coupling features
- optimized classification using scikit-learn
- find the optimal combination of features

## Modules

### bpstudy
Create and manage many studies, without carrying of path, variable names or settings. Everythong is going to be self organized in the clearest way as possible.

### physiology
This module give the physiological informations of intracranial recordings. It will return the brodmann area, the gyrus, the lobe and the hemisphere for a given list of electrodes' coordonates.
The results should be the same as Talairach Daemon

### feature
Extract time resolved features from original signals. Here's the current list of extractable features:
- Filtered signal (using butterworth / bessel / eegfilt filters)
- Power (hilbert / wavelet)
- Phase (based on hilbert transform)
- Phase-amplitude coupling (10 methods) with a variety of normalizations and surrogates computing methods
- Entropy (coming soon)
- Kurtosis (coming soon)
- Fractales, C1 // C2 (very futur)

### classification
Classify each time resolved features using parallel computing. There is also several methods to evaluate the statistical significiance of decoding accuracies:
- binomial
- permutations
	- shuffle labels
	- full randomization
	- intra-class shuffling

The classification modules provide the basics classifiers and cross-validations implemented in scikit-learn with an optimization for large array (which is convenient for features classification).
The classification module also include:
- Time generalization : generalize the decoding performance of features across time

### multifeatures
This module include several well known methods for computing multi-features. It includes :
- Select all the features
- forward / backward / exhaustif features selection
- statistical selection (same methods as in classification module)
- nbest : select nbest features
All this methods can be used individually or they can be combined in a sequential way. An other interesting feature, is that for a given set of features, you can define groups and do a multi-features inside each group.
